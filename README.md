## Running the Prolog Expert System

### Prerequisites
- Ensure that **SWI-Prolog** is installed on your system.

### Steps to Run

1. **Create a Prolog File**
   - Create a file named `loan_approval.pl` and add the rules and facts related to loan approval criteria.

2. **Open SWI-Prolog**
   - Start SWI-Prolog and load the `loan_approval.pl` file.

3. **Run Queries**
   - Execute queries such as `loan_approval(Name).` to check if the given applicant qualifies for the loan.

4. **Exit SWI-Prolog**
   - Use `halt.` to exit.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, check that the Prolog file is correctly loaded and that you are using the right query syntax.
